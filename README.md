# SPA_Python
The coding challenge is about implementing an app that lists shops nearby

## Quickstart

To run the application, first clone the repository to your working directory. From there, activate the virtual environment and install the dependencies before running the application.

```bash
$ # Clone the respository, and change to it
$ git clone https://github.com/issambni/SPA_Python.git && cd $_

$ # Creating a virtualenv for this projec
$ pipenv install
$ # Activate the virtual environmen
$ pipenv shell

$ # Run the Flask application on windows
$ set FLASK_APP=run.py
$ # Run the Flask application on Mac/linux
$ import FLASK_APP=run.py
$ flask run



## Requirements

This project was developed using [**Python 3.6.5**](https://docs.python.org/3/) (however any version of Python 3 *should* work) and [Pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/). The only required packages are [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and [Flask-SQLAlchemy](http://flask-sqlalchemy.pocoo.org/).
